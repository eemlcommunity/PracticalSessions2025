# [[EEML2025](https://www.eeml.eu)] Tutorial 3: Reinforcement Learning

**Authors:** Daniele Calandriello and Miruna PÃ®slar

Reinforcement Learning (RL) is about learning to make good decisions through trial and error. An agent (our learner) interacts with an environment (the world or game it's in) by taking actions. After each action, the environment provides a reward (a score) and a new state (the new observation of the world).

### Outline:

- Setup & Installation
- Intro to Reinforcement Learning: an overview of the main RL concepts.
- Practical 1: build and train an agent from scratch using the REINFORCE algorithm.
- Practical 2 (Advanced): explore more powerful algorithms (A2C and PPO) by introducing concepts like value functions, advantage estimation, and entropy.
- Practical 3: learn about RL*F (Reinforcement Learning from Feedback) and use it to fine-tune GPT-2 to generate more positive text.
